# Start of our Github apprenticeship
This week, we have learned base of Github. First, we created our github account. Then, we used some commands and we have learned how to build repositories.
Afterward, we were finally able to create a github with different files in it : an **index.js** and a **package.json**.
Don't hesitate to click on this link to see more details about our project : [module 1 assignment](https://uciunex.instructure.com/courses/16458/assignments/200842).
My _index.js_ allows me to welcoming you on my server.

### How does it work ?
- First, use the command : **git clone** to clone the repository
- Next, with the command : **npm run script** you should be able to run the _index.js_ file
- Finally, you can open and search "**localhost:3000**" in your browser

# Name of our group project : **_BattleShip Wars_**
Want to have fun during the break ? In that case, play at our game, a **battleship**.
In our project, we add a login page and a shop. For it, we use data bases to stock our data allowing us to buy various weapons for more fun.
Moreover, it's possible for the user to edit his profile, make updates or delete his account.
In addition, the user can earn points during the game and can spend them in the shop.
We also added a ranking for more competition.
Finally, our website saves the data of the players.
